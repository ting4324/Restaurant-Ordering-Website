            <p class="des">Fries</p>
            French fries, also called chips, finger chips, fries, or French pommes frites, side dish or snack typically made from deep-fried potatoes that have been cut into various shapes, especially thin strips. Fries are often salted and served with other items, including ketchup, mayonnaise, or vinegar. In addition, they can be topped with more substantial fare, such as chili. Poutine is a Canadian dish of french fries covered with cheese curds and gravy.
            <br>
            <p class="des">Curly Fries</p>
            If your favorite fry is the curly fry, you might just like curly fry seasoning, a mix of garlic and onion powders, fine cornmeal, paprika, and cayenne. Ever since industrial food manufacturer Simplot released SeasonedCrisp Savory Loops onto the market and promptly won the adoration of cafeteria and Arby’s goers around the U.S., every other manufacturer of curly fries has mimicked that successful formula, so much so that that seasoning defines a curly fry as much as the shape.

            Tuna pizza is a simple Italian pizza that uses tuna as a topping. It consists of a basic pizza dough that is topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella, and olive oil-packed tuna. This classic pizza can be found in most Italian pizzerias since canned tuna is a convenient ingredient that can be used year-round.

            <br>
            <p class="des">Vegetarian Pizza</p>
            As a vegetarian for over a decade, I’ve eaten quite a few veggie pizzas. Truly fantastic veggie pizzas are few and far between.

            <br>
            <p class="des">Mixed Pizza</p>
            This square-cut pizza is served with or without cheese, and often with the cheese underneath the sauce to prevent the pie from becoming soggy.

            <p class="des">Chicken Cabonara Pasta</p>

            <p class="des">Aglio Olio Pasta</p>
            Spaghetti aglio e olio translates to “spaghetti with garlic and oil.” The traditional dish contains little more than these ingredients. It might be finished with a sprinkle of parsley or a pinch of red pepper flakes, but even these are optional.
           <br>
            <p class="des">Prawn Aglio Olio Pasta</p>
            Garnish the pasta aglio e olio with parsley and Parmesan cheese, if desired. Enjoy it on its own, or serve it with a salad like my Caesar salad, Caprese salad, or citrus salad. It would also be delicious with roasted broccoli or cauliflower and homemade focaccia or no-knead bread for sopping up any leftover oil.

            <br>
            <p class="des">Vegetarian Pasta</p>
            Using specially prepared vegetables instead of traditional pasta may be nutritious, but swapping out kale for lasagna noodles may lead to some confused looks around the dinner table.
            <br>
            <p class="des">Asam Curry Pasta</p>
            This one-pan curry pasta is such a quick and easy recipe that it is perfect for a quick lunch, a simple side dish, or a late-night snack.

            <br>
            <p class="des">Americano</p>
            A Café Americano, or what we just call an Americano, combines freshly pulled shots of espresso with hot water to achieve the size of a standard cup of brewed coffee. Americanos were supposedly made popular in Europe during World War II, as the American soldiers wanted something resembling their tried-and-true cups of drip coffee. 
            <br>
            <p class="des">Hot Latte</p>
            Caffè latte often shortened to just latte in English, is a coffee beverage of Italian origin made with espresso and steamed milk.
            <br>
            <p class="des">Iced Latte</p>
            An iced latte is a drink with espresso, milk and optional sweetener. The milk is often frothed to simulate the steamed milk in a standard latte. So what's the difference vs iced coffee? Iced coffee uses brewed coffee and optional milk. Because an iced latte uses espresso, it has a stronger, darker flavor.
            <br>
            <p class="des">Macchiato</p>
            In Italian, the term "macchiato" translates as "marked" or "stained", meaning a stained or marked coffee. The macchiato is an espresso coffee drink, topped with a small amount of foamed or steamed milk to allow the taste of the espresso to still shine through.
            <br>
            <p class="des">Hot Espresso</p>
            As a beverage, espresso is a concentrated form of coffee brewed with high pressure, hot water and finely ground coffee beans. Espresso is thicker than regular coffee and has a layer of “crema” on top, which results from air bubbles mixing with the coffee's oils.
            <br>
            <p class="des">Lemonade</p>
            Lemonade is a sweetened beverage made from lemons, sugar, and water. It is popular in the United States during the spring and summer, when it is generally served chilled with ice. In some countries, the word 'lemonade' is also used to describe any clear carbonated drink; in others, it means any fruit-flavored soda.
            <br>
            <p class="des">Sparkling Peach</p>
            Simple and refreshing, the sparkling peach sunrise is a fabulous nonalcoholic drink.

            <br>
            <p class="des">Sparkling Grapefruit</p>
            Drink it right out of the can or add it to cocktails and other juices for a brightly flavored fizzy boost. Ingredients: sparkling water, fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice, natural flavor, fruit & vegetable juice for color.

            <p class="des">Honey Lemon</p>
            Lemon water mixed with honey is a gentle, yet powerful detoxification agent. It is a liver tonic, improving its function of neutralizing toxins. Its diuretic effect helps in flushing out the toxins through urine.
